### Introduction

Struggling a lot with form validations and buttons that should not work until their forms are valid I decided to create something to help the world ðŸ¤“. It's a very simple plugin that takes advantage of other consolidated plugins to tell your button when it should be enabled for actions or not. Sound nice, right? In fact I created a page to tell you more about it: [https://eagostini.github.io/jquery-hanging](https://eagostini.github.io/jquery-hanging).

I intend to improve the integration between this plugin and the validator dependency for performance matters in the future. If it's not enough or if you found an issue with the plugin just let me know creating an issue [here](https://github.com/eagostini/jquery-hanging/issues). I will really appreciate it!
